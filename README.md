# Script to disable DX11NAVI

This script automates the process to enable regular DX11, as newer AMD RX GPUs use this feature, but causes some stuttering on certain games.
It only disables DX11NAVI, but keeps DX9NAVI.

I created an EXE file so it is easier to execute the script! =D
You can download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/AdverseGecko3/Disable_DXNAVI/releases) tab.
